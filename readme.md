# Fancy backgrounds for MARP slides

This is a set of simple tricks to add fancy backgrounds to your MARP slides. The idea is to use a background image and a gradient to create a nice effect. The background image is a pattern that is repeated in the background, and the gradient is a semi-transparent layer that is placed on top of the background image.
